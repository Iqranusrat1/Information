We were given an unknown sequence , we did the DNA ,RNA, Potein analysis by converting DNA sequence to amino acid sequence and also checked multiple sequence alignment , interactive of target protein with others by using Different Bioinformatic tools. DNA sequence alighnment, RNA stable structure, protein secondary structure ,domains  and properties , Phylogenetic tree , subcellular localization of protein was recorded. Based on these all results we conclude that the unknown sequence was for Small Heat Shock Protein Protein, sHSP of organism Plutella xylostella prent on the gene Plutella xylostella protein lethal(2)essential for life-like (LOC105381252) mRNA, located on the chromosonme 27.
NCBi BLAST, ORF FINDER ,EXPASY, UNIPROT, VIENNA RNA WEB SERVER, CLUSTALW,PFAM PREDICTPROTEIN, CELLO, TARGETP, STRING and other tools were used for this analysis.
THANKS to professor Samina Shakeel for guiding to complete this project.
